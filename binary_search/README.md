# Binary Search

From [tutorialspoint](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_structures_algorithms/binary_search_algorithm.htm):

Binary search is a fast search algorithm with run-time complexity of ÎŸ(log n). This search algorithm works on the principle of divide and conquer. For this algorithm to work properly the data collection should be in sorted form.

Binary search search a particular item by comparing the middle most item of the collection. If match occurs then index of item is returned. If middle item is greater than item then item is searched in sub-array to the right of the middle item other wise item is search in sub-array to the left of the middle item. This process continues on sub-array as well until the size of subarray reduces to zero.

### Recursion / divide and conquer:

> * [Pow(x, n)](pow_x_n.md)

> * [Super Pow](pow_x_n.md)

### Binary Search:

> * [Sqrt(x)](sqrt_x.md)

> * [Valid Perfect Square](sqrt_x.md)

> * [Median of Two Sorted Arrays](../array/median_of_two_sorted_arrays.md)

### Binary Search for rotated array:

> * Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array I/II

> * Search in Rotated Sorted Array I/II

### Search for a range: (play with left/right pointer)

> * First Bad Version

> * [Search for a Range](../array/search_for_a_range.md)

> * Search Insert Position

> * Guess Number Higher or Lower I/II

> * Find Peak Element

> * [Search a 2D Matrix I/II](search_a_2d_matrix.md)

### Search Insert Position

> * Search Insert Position

> * Longest Increasing Subsequence

> * Increasing Triplet Subsequence

> * Russian Doll Envelopes

> * H-Index I/II
