# Construct Binary Tree from Preorder and Inorder Traversal

> Given preorder and inorder traversal of a tree, construct the binary tree.

> Note: You may assume that duplicates do not exist in the tree.

For a given binary tree:

```
        1
      /   \
     2     3
    / \   / \
   4   5  6  7
```
pre-order traversal : [1, 2, 4, 5, 3, 6, 7]

in-order traversal  : [4, 2, 5, 1, 6, 3, 7]

post-order traversal: [4, 5, 2, 6, 7, 3, 1]

```Python
