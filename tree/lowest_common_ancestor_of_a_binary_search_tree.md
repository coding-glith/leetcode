# Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Search Tree

> Given a binary search tree (BST), find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the BST.

> According to the definition of [LCA on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lowest_common_ancestor): “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes v and w as the lowest node in T that has both v and w as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).”

Need to understand that the lowest common ancestor should be the value p <= lca <= q (assume p < q).

```Python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode(object):
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.left = None
#         self.right = None

class Solution(object):
    def lowestCommonAncestor(self, root, p, q):
        """
        :type root: TreeNode
        :type p: TreeNode
        :type q: TreeNode
        :rtype: TreeNode
        """
        while root:
            if root.val > p.val and root.val > q.val:
                root = root.left
            elif root.val < p.val and root.val < q.val:
                root = root.right
            else:
                return root
```
