# Convert Sorted Array to Binary Search Tree

> Given an array where elements are sorted in ascending order, convert it to a height balanced BST.

Binary search tree (BST) is a tree where for each node, the key of its left child is smaller than itself and the key of its right child is larger than itself. For a height balanced BST, the difference between heights of left subtree and right subtree is no more than 1.
