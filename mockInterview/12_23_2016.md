### 1. Word Break

> "leetcode" -> ["leet", "code"]

> the status of currect character "e" depends on the status of its previous character "t" and it the substring "code" in the dictionary.

> to maintain the status of the first character, need to add dummy results of "" at the beginning.

> Worst case complexity O(N^2). like "leetcode" in ["leetcode"].


### 2. Word Break II

> usually when need to return all possible solutions in an array, it's a backtracking problem.

> first check if it can be break, then go through the string, when find a match, store it in the results and pass the latter substring to do the same thing. O(N^2).

> Note: All parameters (arguments) in the Python language are passed by reference. It means if you change what a parameter refers to within a function, the change also reflects back in the calling function. But if you assign new reference for the same variable name inside the function, it won't affect the outside variable. refer to [here](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_functions.htm).
