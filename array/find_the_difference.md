# Find the Difference

> Given two strings s and t which consist of only lowercase letters.

> String t is generated by random shuffling string s and then add one more letter at a random position.

> Find the letter that was added in t.

> Example:

> ```
Input:
s = "abcd"
t = "abcde"
Output:
e
Explanation:
'e' is the letter that was added.
```
