# Majority Element

> Given an array of size n, find the majority element. The majority element is the element that appears more than âŒŠ n/2 âŒ‹ times.

> You may assume that the array is non-empty and the majority element always exist in the array.

Python has a method "count()" for array to count the frequency of an element. But here we go through the array and count one by one.

```Python
class Solution(object):
    def majorityElement(self, nums):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        numDict = {}
        for i in xrange(len(nums)):
            if nums[i] not in numDict:
                numDict[nums[i]] = 0
            else:
                numDict[nums[i]] += 1
            if numDict[nums[i]] >= len(nums) / 2:
                return nums[i]
```
