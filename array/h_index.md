# H-Index

> Given an array of citations (each citation is a non-negative integer) of a researcher, write a function to compute the researcher's h-index.

> According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia: "A scientist has index h if h of his/her N papers have at least h citations each, and the other N âˆ’ h papers have no more than h citations each."

> For example, given citations = [3, 0, 6, 1, 5], which means the researcher has 5 papers in total and each of them had received 3, 0, 6, 1, 5 citations respectively. Since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each and the remaining two with no more than 3 citations each, his h-index is 3.

> Note: If there are several possible values for h, the maximum one is taken as the h-index.

> Hint:

> * An easy approach is to sort the array first.

> * What are the possible values of h-index?

> * A faster approach is to use extra space.

```Python
class Solution(object):
    def hIndex(self, citations):
        """
        :type citations: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        citations.sort()
        res = 0
        for i in xrange(len(citations)):
            res = max(res, min(citations[i], len(citations[i:])))
        return res
```

# H-Index II

> Follow up for H-Index: What if the citations array is sorted in ascending order? Could you optimize your algorithm?

> Hint:

> * Expected runtime complexity is in O(log n) and the input is sorted.

```Python
class Solution(object):
    def hIndex(self, citations):
        """
        :type citations: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        l, r = 0, len(citations) - 1
        while l <= r:
            mid = (l + r) / 2
            if citations[mid] >= len(citations) - mid:
                r = mid - 1
            else:
                l = mid + 1
        return len(citations) - l
```
