# Minimum Size Subarray Sum

> Given an array of n positive integers and a positive integer s, find the minimal length of a subarray of which the sum â‰¥ s. If there isn't one, return 0 instead.

> For example, given the array [2,3,1,2,4,3] and s = 7,

> the subarray [4,3] has the minimal length under the problem constraint.

O(N) solution. Even though there's two loops, the two pointer start and i are like two runners, i runs faster and start runs slower, but they only go through the array once.

```Python
class Solution(object):
    def minSubArrayLen(self, s, nums):
        """
        :type s: int
        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        res, sumVal, flag, start = sys.maxint, 0, False, -1
        for i, val in enumerate(nums):
            sumVal += val
            if sumVal >= s:
                flag = True
                while sumVal >= s:
                    res = min(res, i - start)
                    start += 1
                    sumVal -= nums[start]
        return res if flag else 0
```
